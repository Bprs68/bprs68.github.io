## About Me

I'm Bhaskar Kumar, a Data Scientist by title, but at heart, I'm a flaneur and solution architect. I weave together Computer Science, Mathematics, Cloud Computing, and AI to solve meaningful problems. My approach combines these disciplines to create solutions that matter.

When I'm not architecting solutions or working on passion projects, you'll find me lost in books or immersed in films. This balance of technical precision and creative exploration defines both my work and life.
