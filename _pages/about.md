I'm Bhaskar Kumar, a Data Scientist by title, but at heart, I'm a flaneur and solution architect. I weave together Computer Science, Mathematics, Cloud Computing, and AI to solve meaningful problems. My approach combines these disciplines to create solutions that matter.

## Reading

I love diving into books of all genres, particularly philosophy, literature, and science.

**Latest read:**
- The Black Swan by Nassem Taleb

**Currently reading:**
- *War and Peace* by Leo Tolstoy
- *India's struggle for Independence* by Bipin Chandra (Audiobook)

## Movies

I enjoy experiencing different cultures and perspectives through cinema.

**Favorite genres:**
- World Cinema
- Classics
- Bollywood
- Independent Films

When I'm not architecting solutions or working on passion projects, you'll find me lost in books or immersed in films. This balance of technical precision and creative exploration defines both my work and life.
